# This program calculates total sales for a department and determines a manager's bonus.
# It uses a loop for entering weekly sales for each salesperson and calculates bonuses based on sales goals.

# Input: Sales goal for the month
sales_goal = float(input("Enter the sales goal for the month: $"))

total_sales = 0  # Variable to store total sales for the department
num_salespeople = 0  # Variable to store the number of salespeople

while True:
    # Increase the count of salespeople
    num_salespeople += 1

    # Initialize a variable to store a salesperson's total sales for four weeks
    salesperson_total = 0
    # Loop to input sales for each week for the current salesperson
    for week in range(1, 5):
        weekly_sales = float(input(f"Salesperson {num_salespeople} week {week}: $"))
        salesperson_total += weekly_sales

    # Add the salesperson's total sales to the department's total sales
    total_sales += salesperson_total

    # Ask the manager if there is another salesperson
    another = input("Is there another salesperson? (y/n): ").lower()

    if another != 'y':  # Exit the loop if there are no more salespeople
        break

# Calculate the manager's bonus based on the sales goal
if total_sales > sales_goal:
    manager_bonus = 0.05 * total_sales  # 5% bonus if total sales exceed the sales goal
else:
    manager_bonus = 0.02 * total_sales  # 2% bonus if total sales are less than or equal to the sales goal

# Output the results
print("\n--- Department Sales Summary ---")
print(f"Number of salespeople: {num_salespeople}")
print(f"Total sales for the department: ${total_sales}")
